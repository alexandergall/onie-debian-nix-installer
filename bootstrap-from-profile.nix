### Re-create a debootstrap tarball as originally produced by
### "debootsrap --make-tarball" from a tarball with the .deb files
### removed and a Nix expression containing the download URLs of the
### .deb files.
###
### bootstrapProfile must be a derivation containing three files:
###
###   bootstrap.tar
###     The original tarball with all .deb files removed
###
###   pkgs.nix
###     A list of attribute Sets with attributes
###        url    Download URL of the .deb file
###        sha256 The sha256 hash of the file
###        name   The name of the file in the original
###               tarball
###   release.nix
###     The name of the Debian release as a string
###
### Profiles are created with the mk-profile.sh utility, which selects
### the packages to include for debootstrap.
